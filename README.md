# 🔒 Monero Node VPN Solution for Starlink Connections 🛰️

## 🌐 Overview

This project offers a solution to the port forwarding issues encountered when running a Monero node on Starlink connections. Three approaches are provided:

1. **🔐 OpenVPN**: Creates an encrypted tunnel to an external VPN server, routing Monero traffic through this server which has open ports.

2. **🌍 ZeroTier**: Establishes a global peer-to-peer virtual network, bypassing NATs and firewalls without a central server, ideal for stable connections.

3. **⚙️ Monero with VPN Configuration**: Adapts Monero node parameters to work optimally on an already configured VPN interface.

Tor for secure RPC connections to your wallet, while using the VPN for blockchain P2P traffic.

Your node's .onion addresses will remain accessible via Tor.
Primary P2P traffic will go through the VPN if you configure Monero to use this interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 Automatic VPN interface detection
- 🛡️ Enhanced privacy through encrypted connections
- 🔌 No port forwarding required on your Starlink router
- 🤝 Better peer connectivity for your Monero node
- 🔒 Secured RPC connections
- 🔄 Stability during IP address changes

## 🛠️ Installation

Simply run " Easynode_starlink.sh " script and choose menu option for vpn.

## 🎯 Purpose

These solutions enable running a full Monero node behind Starlink without requiring port forwarding or third-party routers, using VPN technologies to establish reliable and secure incoming connections.

## 🔗 Compatibility
